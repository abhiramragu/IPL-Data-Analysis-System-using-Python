# IPL Data Analysis System using Python

This project is a Python-based data analytics system for analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) match data.  
It processes structured match data and produces meaningful statistics and insights about matches, teams and players.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how raw cricket match data can be converted into structured analytical information using Python and Pandas.

This repository contains two versions of the implementation to show the evolution of the solution.

## Versions Overview

### Version 1 – JSON Direct Analysis

The first version directly reads and processes raw JSON match files.

Main characteristics:
- Data is read directly from JSON files
- Logic is written using native Python data structures
- Suitable for understanding the raw data format and building initial analytics
- Acts as a prototype implementation


### Version 2 – DataFrame Based Analysis

The second version improves the design by converting raw data into Pandas DataFrames.

Main characteristics:
- Raw match data is converted into structured DataFrames
- Queries and analytics become easier and more readable
- Better scalability for larger datasets
- Cleaner and more maintainable code structure

This version represents the improved and recommended pipeline.

## Dataset
The repository already contains the IPL dataset archive inside the `data/raw` folder.

The project also provides optional helper scripts in the v1_json_direct_analysis
folder to automatically download and extract the dataset if required.

The project uses IPL match data in structured format (such as ball-by-ball or match level data).

The original data is taken from :
- Cricsheet IPL JSON datasets

## Features

- Match level statistics extraction
- Team performance analysis
- Player performance analysis
- Structured transformation of raw data into analytical format
- Clear separation between raw data handling and analytical processing
- Two independent implementations to show design improvement

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- JSON processing
- Basic data analysis and aggregation techniques

## Outputs

The project generates analytical results such as:

- Team level performance summaries
- Player statistics
- Match level insights
- Aggregated statistics derived from raw match data

The outputs are displayed in tabular or textual form through the program execution.

All the graphs generated by the project can be found in the `Graphs` folder inside Version 2.

## Why Two Versions?

This project intentionally contains two versions to demonstrate:

- how an initial raw-data based solution is built
- how the same solution can be redesigned using DataFrames for better analytics and maintainability

This highlights practical software engineering improvement in data analytics projects.


## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, the following concepts are demonstrated:

- working with structured sports datasets
- reading and processing JSON data
- transforming raw data into analytical structures
- using Pandas for data aggregation
- designing scalable data analytics pipelines


## Future Improvements

- Adding visualizations (matplotlib / seaborn)
- Creating a single unified pipeline for all datasets
- Adding player comparison dashboards
- Exporting results to CSV files
- Automating dataset loading
- Scaling the analysis to other formats of the game
